 SN76489 / NES 2A03 Simulator and VGM Player for Colour Maximite 2
 (USE LAST BETA FIRMWARE FOR CMM2 TO USE THIS)
 
This is not an emulator and is far from perfect. ItÂ´s only a little include file for MMBasic and Colour Maximite 2 that play VGM files for SN76489 chips and with some limitations, for the NES 2A03.
